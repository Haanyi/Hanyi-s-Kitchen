👋 Hi, I’m @Haanyi  
🌍 A culture-lover exploring all corners of society. A curious mind passionate about VC/PE. I believe in the transformative power of finance to drive societal change, and the pursuit of a brighter future.

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Data analysis languages: Python, R programming, SQL, VBA
- Economic modeling and econometrics

⚡ Fun fact: I think deeply, and sometimes it gets overwhelming — but hey, that’s where the best ideas often come from. Also, I find rain strangely inspiring for those introspective moments.
